# Portfolio
This is my portfolio for my final Project 
This project aims to compare and see if blockchains can be used in healthcare to secure and keep medical data. 
This has been archived by testing and comparing two Hyperledger fabric blockchains with different consensus mechanisms a Proof of work and a proof of stake blockchain. 
These blockchains were created via amazon web services EC2 servers where I had added the Hyperledger fabric blockchain in the servers and then created synthetic medical data to send keep and retrieve data. 
Then I had tested to see if this data could be attacked or be manipulated. 
Whilst this was happening, I was primarily focusing on how the data was sent and the times it took for the data to be received. 
This allowed me to then create a map of where to place nodes strategically so we could have the optimal efficiency in the nodes.
This had also allowed me to figure out other areas to improve and fix in these blockchains specifically.
